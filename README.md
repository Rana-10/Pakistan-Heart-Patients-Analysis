Pakistan Heart Patients Analysis

Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of heart patients in Pakistan, using real clinical data to uncover key factors linked to heart disease. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and advanced visualizations for actionable health insights.

🔍 Overview

This project analyzes 368 heart patient records with features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, thalach, oldpeak, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking.
Goals include:

Understanding demographic & clinical patterns

Identifying correlations with disease severity

Visualizing trends using Python

🧹 Data Preparation

Cleaned duplicated & missing values

Standardized labels (Gender, Diabetes, Smoking)

Created new attributes: Age Group, Risk Score, Risk Category, Comorbidity Type

Exported cleaned dataset for analysis

📈 Visual Insights

Key visualizations included:

Age distribution by gender

Cholesterol levels by gender

Cholesterol vs Max Heart Rate

Pairplot of clinical indicators

Radar chart for risk categories

Stacked bar showing diabetes + hypertension impact

🩺 Key Findings

Most patients fall between 50–65 years

Females show higher cholesterol averages

Higher oldpeak, BP, and cholesterol → higher severity

Diabetes + hypertension combined significantly increase risk

Severe cases show lower max heart rate (thalach)
